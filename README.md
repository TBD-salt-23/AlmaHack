# AlmaHack
## Welcome to AlmaHack! 
Our application is designed to simplify the process of scheduling your day and help you save time. All you need to do is tell us when you're free and add your tasks!

Scheduling our own tasks is often both the source of our power and the cause of our weakness. We know what we need to do and when we have free time, but because we can create new tasks on our calendar, we can also not take them seriously enough. AlmaHack acts as a mediator between you and your calendar, giving you the feeling of following what someone else created while also ensuring that it works for your specific needs.

## Getting Started
Getting started is easy - simply log in with your Google account and add a new task. Our app will schedule your errands in your Google Calendar for the upcoming week during the specified time slot. Then, all you have to do is complete your tasks!
